# concepts behind kubernetes

- declarative vs imperative
- control loops
- reconciliation

### declarative vs imperative

declarative - describes desired state  
imperative - tell about action that needs to be done

### control loop

![control loop](../asset/controlLoop.png)

### reconciliation

- reconciliation is simply making the actual state look like the desired state via the control loop
- occurs in numerous places throughout kubernetes
  - `kubectl apply -f file.yaml`
