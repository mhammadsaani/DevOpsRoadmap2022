## Introduction

**Markup Language:** A computer language that consists of easily understood keywords, names, or tags that help format the overall view of a page and the data it contains

**YAML:** YAML Ain't Markup Language 
- It is basically a human readable language 
- It is data format which is used to exchange data
- It is similar to XML & JSON
- It is a data serialization language
- In YAML we can store only data, and not commands

**Serialization** is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file. 

Its main purpose is to save the state of an object in order to be able to recreate it when needed. 

The reverse process is called **Deserialization.**

**Data Serialization:** is the process of converting data objects i.e regions of storage that contain certain values present in complex data structures, into a stream of bytes for storage and transmission purposes.

**Why it is known as YAML Ain't Markup Language?** <br/>
YAML stores data as well as documents

Extension of YAML: `.yaml` `yml`

**Uses of YAML:**
- Configuration files, like Docker, Kubernetes
- Logs
- Caches

**Benefits of YAML:**
- Simple and easy to read
- It has a strict syntax; identation is important
- Easily convertible to JSON, XML
- YAML is used by most languages
- More powerful when representing complex data
- Parsing is easy and various tools are available

**NOTE:** 
- YAML is case-sensitive
- Identation is important, otherwise it will throw an error
- --- is used to represent different types of documents.
- ... is used to end a document.
- YAML doesn't support multiline comments

## Demo of YAML File

```
# Key-Value Pairs

  1: "this is my roll no."
---
#Lists
- apple

## Advanced Data Types in YAML

```
student: !!seq
 - marks
 - name
 - roll_no
 
 # like this also
 cities: [new delhi, mumbai]
 
 # some of the keys of the seq will be empty
 # sparse seq
 sparse seq:
  - hey
  - how
  -
  - Null
  - sup
  
 # nested sequence
 -
  - mango
  - apple
  - banana
 - 
  - marks
  - roll_no
  - date
  
 # key: value pairs are called maps
 !!map
 
 #nested mappingsL map within a map
 name: Sadab Halim
 role:
  age: 21
  job: student
 
 # same as
 name: Sadab Halim
 role: (age: 21, job: student)
 
 #pairs: keys may have duplicate values
 # !!pairs
 
 pair example: !!pairs
 - job: student
 - job: developer
 
 # same as
 pair example: !!pairs [job: student, job: teacher]
 # this will be an array of hashtables
 
 # !!set will allow you to have unique values
 names: !!set
  ? Sadab
  ? Aarav
 
 # dictionary !!omap
 people: !!omap
  - Sadab:
     name: Sadab Halim
     age: 21
  - Aarav:
     name: Aarav OP
     age: 20
  
 # reusing some properties using anchors

  fav fruits: mango
  dislikes: grapes
  
 person1:
  name: Sadab Halim
  <<: *likes
  
 person2:
  name: Aarav
  <<: *likes
  dislikes: berries
  
 # this will look like
