# Computer Networking (CCNA)

## TCP/IP (Web Protocols)
- **HTTP:** Hyper Text Transfer Protocol
- **DHCP:** Dynamic Host Control Protocol
- **FTP:** File Transfer Protocol
- **SMTP:** Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, _used to send email_
- **POP3 & IMAC:** _used to receive email_
- **SSH:** Secure Shell
- **VNC:** Virtual Network Computing

**Telnet:** terminal immutation that enables the user to remote host/device using telnet
**UDP:** Stateless connection

## Process, Threads, Sockets, Ports

**Process:** is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads.

**Thread:** is a single sequence stream within a process. Threads have same properties as of the process so they are called as light weight process.

**Socket:** is one endpoint of a two way communication link between two programs running on the netwo.
The socket mechanisk provies a means of inter-proces communication (IPC) by establishing named contact point between which the communiation take place.

**Port:** is a physical docking point using which an external device can be connected to the computer. It can also be programmatic docking point through which information flows from a program to the computer or over the Internet. <br/>

A network port which is provided by the Transport Layer protocols of Internet Protocol suite, such as Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Diagram Protocol (UDP) is a number which serving endpoint communication between two computers.

IP Address tells us which device we are working with while ports tell us which application we are working with.

Their may be possibility of many processes of single application is running like opening up many tabs in chrome when the response is coming back how it will know which tab to give the data. This can be resolved using EPHEMERAL PORTS.

## HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol):
- It is a client server protocol and it tells us how we request this data from the server and also tells us how the server sends back to the client.
- When a client makes a request to the server, it is known as an _HTTP Request_. <br/>
  When a server sends back response to the client, it is known as _HTTP Response_.
- These are application layer protocols
- HTTP uses TCP
- It is a stateless protocol; server will not store any information about client by default.

**Method** is basically tells the server what to do

**HTTP Methods**
- **GET:** It means we are requesting some data
- **POST:** Client gives some data to the server like web forms
- **PUT:** Puts data at a specific location.
- **DELETE:** To delete data from the user

**Error/Status Code:** When we send a request to the server, we need some sort of a way to know whether the request is successful or not. <br/>
For this there exists STATUS CODE: <br/>
Ex: 200 - request was successful <br/>
    404 - not found <br/>
    400 - bad request <br/>
    500 - internal server error <br/>

1XX - Informational Category <br/>
2XX - Success Code <br/>
3XX - Redirecting Purpose <br/>
4XX - Client Error <br/>
5XX - Server Error <br/>

## Cookies
- Cookies are files, generally from the visited webpages, which are stored on a user's computer. They hold a small amount of data, specific to a particular client and website, and can be accessed either by the web server or the client computer which can be usernames, password, session token, etc.

- When we visit the web page for the first time, the cookie is set and whenever we make a new request, in the request header a cookie will be sent. <br/>
Then the server will look into the database and identify the state.

**Types of Cookies:**
- **Session Cookies:** hese are mainly used by online shops and allows you to keep items in your basket when shopping online. These cookies expire after a specific time or when the browser is closed.
- **Permanent Cookies:** These remain in operation, even when you have closed the browser. They remember your login details and password so you donâ€™t have to type them in every time you use the site. It is recommended that you delete these type of cookies after a specific time.
- **Third-Party Cookies:** These are installed by third parties for collecting certain information. For example: Google Maps.
