## DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS is a directory service that provides a mapping between the name of a host on the network and its numerical address. <br/>

## Transport Layer
- Data transferred between one computer to another is done by using Network Layer
- Transport layer is a layer which lies over devices.
- The role of the transport layer is to take the data from the network to application.

  Network Layer: Network <--> Network <br/>
  Transport Layer: Network <--> Abstraction <br/>
- Provides Abstraction
- Located on the devices
- Data Travels in Packets

- Transport Layer will attach these socket part numbers to that packets
- Transport Layer also takes control of congestion control
- Congestion control algorithms are built in TCP

## Checksum

## UDP (User Datagram Protocol)
The User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is simplest Transport Layer communication protocol available of the TCP/IP protocol suite. It involves minimum amount of communication mechanism. UDP is said to be an unreliable transport protocol but it uses IP services which provides best effort delivery mechanism.

**Features:**
- UDP is good protocol for data flowing in one direction
- UDP is simple and suitable for query based communications
- UDP is not connection oriented.
- UDP does not provide congestion control mechanism.

UDP header contains four main parameters:
- Source Port: This 16 bits information is used to identify the source port of the packet.
- Destination Port: This 16 bits information, is used identify application level service on destination machine.
- Length: It is 16-bits field and minimum value is 8-byte.
- Checksum: This field stores the checksum value generated by the sender before sending. IPv4 has this field as optional so when checksum field does not contain any value it is made 0 and all its bits are set to zero.

## TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
It is a transport layer protocol that facilitates the transmission of packets from source to destination. It is a connection-oriented protocol that means it establishes the connection prior to the communication that occurs between the computing devices in a network. <br/>

This protocol is used with an IP protocol, so together, they are referred to as a TCP/IP.

The main functionality of the TCP is to take the data from the application layer. Then it divides the data into a several packets, provides numbering to these packets, and finally transmits these packets to the destination.

The TCP, on the other side, will reassemble the packets and transmits them to the application layer.

Takes control of: 
- when data does not arrive
- maintains the order of data (using sequence number)

**Features:**
- Connection Oriented
- Error Control
- Congestion Control
- Full Duplex

## Three Way Handshake

## TCP (Network Layer)
- In Network Layer we work with routers
- Every router has a network address
- Every router will check whether the packet is for that router, if not then it will forward that using forward table in routing table.

## Control Plane
The control plane is a set of services within the network that perform traffic management functions, including security, routing, load balancing, and analysis.

It is used to build these routing tables:
- Routers --> Nodes
- Links --> Edges

There are two types of Routing used to create tables
1. **Static Routing**
    - Adding address manually
    - It's not adaptive
 
2. **Dynamic Routing**
    - When there is a change in network it will evolve accordingly.
  
## IP (Internt Protocol)
IP stands for Internet Protocol. It is defined in the TCP/IP model used for sending the packets from source to destination.

The main task of IP is to deliver the packets from source to the destination based on the IP addresses available in the packet headers. 

An IP protocol provides the connectionless service, which is accompanied by two transport protocols, i.e., TCP/IP and UDP/IP, so internet protocol is also known as TCP/IP or UDP/IP.

The first version of IP was IPv4. After IPv4, IPv6 came into the market.

## Packets
A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet.

A packet is made up of 2 parts:
- Header: tells the packet where it's going & other housekeeping. It is of 20 bytes
- The data the packet is carrying

**Time To Live:** It is a number after hat number of hops, the packet doesn't reach, then it will leave.


## IPv4 V/S IPv6

| IPv4                           | IPv6                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| It has a 32 bit address length | It has a 128 bit address length |
| It supports manual and DHCP address configuration | It supports auto and renumbering address configuration |
| In IPv4 end to end, connection integrity is unachievable | In IPv6 end to end, connection integrity is achievable |
| The security feature is dependent on application | IPSEC is an inbuilt security feature in the IPv6 protocol |
| Address representation of IPv4 is in decimal | Address representation of IPv6 is in hexadecimal |
| In IPv4 checksum field is available | In IPv6 checksum field is not available |
| It has broadcast message transition scheme | In IPv6 multicase and anycast message transmission scheme is available |
| In IPv4 encryption and authentication facility not provided | In IPv6 encryption and authentication are provided |
| IPv4 has a header of 20-60 bytes | IPv6 has header of 40 bytes fixed. |

## Middle Boxes
- They are extra devices that also interact with IP packets.
- Mostly, it will be in network layer but it can also be in transport layer as well.
- It filters out IP Packets based on various rules:
  - Address
  - Modify Packets
  - Port Numbers
  - Flags
  - Protocols

**Types of Firewall:**
- Connected to global internet
- Your local network

**Stateless Firewall:** doesn't maintain a state

**Stateful Firewall:** see the packet and maintain its state, more efficient

## NAT (Network Address Translation)
It is a method of mapping an IP Address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.

## TCP (Data Link Layer)
Data Link Layer is second layer of OSI Layered Model. <br/>

The data packets that we receive from the network layer. The data link layer is responsible to send these oackets over a physical link.

**DHCP:** Dyynamic Host Configuration Tool

In Data Link Layer, the devices communicate with each other using Data Link Layer Address

Let's say device 1 needs to send something to device 4, first it will loop up in its cache. If it does not have then it will ask all other devicees.

This is known as **ARP Cache (Address Resolution Protocol)**

Frame consists of:
- DLLA of sender
- IP Address of destination

**MAC:** Media Access Control

**NOTE:**
Transport --> Segment <br/>
Network --> Packet <br/>
Data Link --> Frames <br/>
