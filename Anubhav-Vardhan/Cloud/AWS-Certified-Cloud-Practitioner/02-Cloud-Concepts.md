# What is Cloud Computing

The practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store,
manage and process data, rather than a local server or a personal computer.

|ON PREMISE|CLOUD PROVIDERS|
|---|---|
|You own the server|Someone else owns the server|
|You hire the IT people|Someone else hires the IT people|
|You pay or rent the real estate|Someone else pays or rent the real estate|
|You take all the risk|You are responsible for configuring cloud services and code. someoen else takes care of the rest|

# Evolution of Cloud Hosting

### Dedicated Sever

- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- Runs a single web-app/site
- Very expensive
- High maintainance
- High Security

### Virtual Private Server (VPS)

- One physical machine dedicated to a single business
- The physical machine is virtualized into sub-machines
- Runs multiple web-apps/sites
- Better utilization and isolation of resources

### Shared Hosting

- One physical machine, shared by hundreds of businesses
- Relies on most tenants under-utilizing their resources
- Very cheap
- limited functionality
- Poor isolation

### Cloud Hosting

- Multiple physical machines that act as one system
- The system is abstracted into multiple cloud services
- Flexible
- Scalable
- Secure
- Cost-effective
- High configurability

# What is Amazon?

An American multinational computer technology corporation headquatered
in Seattle, Washington

Amazon was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos and the company started as an
online store for books and expanded to other products

Amazon has expanded beyond just an online store into:
- cloud computing (Amazon web services)
- digital streaming
- grocery store
- AI
- low orbit satellites

# What is AWS?

Amazon calls their cloud provoder service Amazon web Services, commonly
referred to just AWS

AWS was launched in 2006 and is the leading cloud service provider in the world

Cloud service provider can be initilized as CSPs

### Some history of services

- Simple Queue Service (SQS) was the first AWS service launched in 2004
- Simple Storage Service (S3) was launched in March of 2006
- Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) was launched in August of 2006

- In November 2010, all of Amazon.com's retail sites had migrated to AWS
- To support industry wide training and skill standradization, AWS began offering
  certification program for computer engineers, on April, 2013
  
# What is a Cloud Service Provider?

A CSP is a company which 
- provides multiple cloud services eg. tens to hundreds of services
- those cloud services can be chained together to create cloud architecture
- those cloud services are available via single unified API eg. AWS API
- those cloud services utilize metered billing based on usage eg. per second, per hour
- those cloud services have rich monitoring built in eg. AWS CloudTrail
- those cloud services have Infrastucture as a Service (IaaS) offering
- those cloud services offer automation via Infrastucture as code (IaC)
- Example of an architecture

If a company offers multiple cloud services under a single UI but do not 
meet most of or all of these requirements, it would be referred to as a 
Cloud Platform eg, Twilio, HashiCorp, Databricks

# Landscape of CSPs

### Tier-1 (Top Tier)

- Early to market 
- wide offering
- strong synergies between services
- well recognized in the industry

Example:
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Microsoft Azure
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Alibaba Cloud

### Tier-2 (Mid Tier)

- Backed by well known tech companies
- slow to innovate and turned to specialization

Example:
- IBM Cloud
- Oracle Cloud
- Rackspace (OpenStack)

### Tier-3 (Light Tier)

- Virtual Private Servers (VPS) turned to offer core IaaS offering.
- Simple
- Cost-effective

Example:
- Vultr
- Digital Ocean
- Linode

# Common Cloud Services

A cloud service provider can have 100s of cloud services that are
grouped into various types of services.
The four most common types of cloud services (the 4 core) for infrastucture
as a Service (IaaS) would be:

### Compute
like a virtual computer that can run applications, programs, and code

### Networking
like a virtual network defining internet connections or network isolations
between services or outbound to the internet

### Storage
like having a virtual hard drive that can store files

### Databases
like a virtual database for storing reporting data or a database for general
purpose web application

**AWS has over 200+ cloud services**
The term "cloud computing" can be used to refer all categories, even though it has
"compute" in the name.

# AWS Technology Overview

Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) that are Infrastucture as a Service (IaaS)
will always have 4 core cloud offerings:
- Compute: **EC2** virtual machines
- Storage: **EBS** virtual hard drives
- Database: **RDS** SQL databases
- Networking (and content Delivery): **VPC** private cloud network

Other categories:
- Analytics
- Application Integration
- AR and VR
- AWS Cost Management
- Blockchain
- Business Application
- Containers
- Costumer Engagement
- Developer Tools
- End User Computing
- Game Tech
- Internet of Things
- Machine Learning
- Management and Governance

# Evolution of Computing

### Dedicated

- A physical server wholly utilized by a single costumer
- You have to guess your capacity
- You'll overpay for an underutilized server
- You can't vertically scale, you need manual migration
- Replacing a server is very difficult
- You are limited by your host OS
- Multiple apps can result in conflicts in resource sharing
- You have a guarantee* if security, privacy and full utility of underlying resources

### VMs

- You can run multiple Virtual Machines on one machine
- Hypervisor is a software layer that lets you run VMs
- A physical server shared by multiple costumers
- You are to pay for a fraction of server
- You'll overpay for an underutilized virtual machine
- You are limited by your guest OS
- multiple apps on single VM can result in conflict in resource sharing
- Easy to export and import images for migration
- easy to vertical or horizontally scale

### Containers

- virtual machines running multiple containers
- Docker Daemon is a software that lets you run multiple containers
- You can maximize the utilization of available capacity which can be more cost-effective
- Containers share the same underlying OS. So, containers are more efficient than multiple VMs
- Multiple apps can run side by side without being limited to same OS 
  requirements and will not cause conflicts during resource sharing
  
### Functions

- managed VMs running managed containers
- known as serverless compute
- you upload a code, choose the amount of memory and duration
- only responsible for code and data, nothing else
- very cost effective, only pay for the time code is running, VMs only run when there is code to be executed
- cold start is a side effect of this setup

# Types of Cloud Computing

### SaaS (Software as a Service)

- A product that is run and managed by the service provider.
- Don't worry about how the service is maintained
- It just works and remains available
- Generally designed with costumers in mind

Example: Salesforce, Gmail, Office365

### PaaS (Platform as a Service)

- Focus on deployment and management of your apps
- Don't worry about provisioning, configuring or understanding the hardware or OS
- Intended for Developers

Example: Elastic beanstalk, heroku, Google appengine

### IaaS (Infrastucture as a Service)

- The basic building blocks for cloud IT
- Provides access to networking features, computers and data storage space
- Don't worry about IT staff. data centers and hardware
- Intended for Administrators

Example: MS Azure, AWS, Oracle Cloud

# Cloud Computing Deployment Models

### Public Cloud

- Everything (the workload or project) is built on the CSP. 
- Also known as: Cloud-Native* or Cloud First

### Private Cloud

- Everything built on company's datacenters
- Also known as On-premise
- The cloud could be OpenStack

### Hybrid

- Using both on-premise and a cloud service provider

### Cross-Cloud

- Using multiple cloud providers aka multi-cloud

Anthos is GCP's offering for a control plane across multiple CSPs and on-premise environments


# Deployment Model Use Cases

| CLOUD | HYBRID | ON-PREMISE |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fully utilizing cloud computing | Using both cloud and on-premise | Deploying resources on-premises, using virtualization and resource management tools,sometimes called "private cloud" |
| Companies that are starting out today or are small enough to make a leap from VPS to CSP | Organizations that started with their own data centers but can't fully move to cloud due to effort of migration or security compliance | Organizations that cannot run on cloud due to strict security compliance or the sheer size of their organization |
| Startups, SaaS offerings, New projects and companies | Banks, Fintech, Investment management, Large professional server providers, Legacy on-premise | Public sector eg. government, Super sensitive data eg, hospitals, Large enterprise with heavy regulation eg. Insurance companies |
| | | There really isn't a good reason to be fully on-premise |
